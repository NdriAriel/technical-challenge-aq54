# AQ54 Data Visualization App with Angular and Docker-Compose and Nodejs

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and configurations for AQ54 data visualization app built with Angular, Docker-Compose,
 Node.js, and the AirQino API. The app is designed to fetch and display air quality data in a visually appealing manner.
 AirQino is a high-precision environmental monitoring platform, born from the need to create a network of stations for accurately assessing the quality of urban environment.
 for maore detail about AirQuino you can navigate to [airqino](https://www.airqino.it).
 This repository is a well structured code based on clean Architecture in conjunction with SOLID principles
